7- What will this output
"function example()
{

12- Eleanor is testing a walking app. what will the result be if Elenor enters 3 when prompted for the number of miles she wants to walk this week?
"var miles=prompt("Enter the number of miles you want to walk this week");
for (let i = 0; i < miles; i++)
{
 document.write ("You have walked " + i + " miles this week." + "<br />");
}
document.write ("Great job! You reached your walking goal for the week.");"

	despite "i++" it starts off with zero

13- the break statement is used to exit a control structure

14- output...

    document.write(domain);
  }
  else
  {
    document.write("This is an invalid email.");
  }
  
	outputs .com

                    if(i % 2 == 0){
                    evenNums += i + "<br>";
                    }
                 }

I need to work on for loops

23- 
	You can use the BREAK statement to exit a loop that would otherwise continue to execute. 
	
	You use the CONTINUE statement to force the flow of control back to the top of the loop. 
	
	You use the SWITCH statement to compare a value against other values, searching for a match; the code associated with the match will then execute
